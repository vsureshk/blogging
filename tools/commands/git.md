git clone git@github.com:senthilnayagam/git-scripts.git


I want to know which branch are active

./git-branches-with-latest-commits.sh

track all the branches locally

./git-fetch-all-remote-branches.sh

identify large commits, as a single line as it helps with subsequent processing

./git-shortstat-singleline.sh

sort files by lines of code, ignoring binary files ./git-list-files-by-lines.sh

keyword statistics for a file extension ./git-keywords-stats.sh *.rb







git whatchanged --since="8 hours ago"
git whatchanged --since="1 days ago"
git whatchanged --since="1 weeks ago"
